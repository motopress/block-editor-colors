Change Gutenberg block editor colors or create new ones.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to edit default Gutenberg block editor colors or the ones registered in a theme, as well as add your own colors! Since this is a global site configuration (applied sitewide), you can much easier go with your brand color scheme, without a need to manually change colors for each block each time.

Once the plugin is installed and activated, navigate to Settings > Editor Colors to customize colors.

There are two sections to customize colors globally for your website:

= Custom Colors =

Here you can create new colors for the block color palette. You will not lose these colors when you change a theme. These colors can be deactivated or transferred via XML.

= Default Colors =

Here you can edit colors that are registered by your active WordPress theme or default Gutenberg block colors.

= Need more blocks? =

If you feel short of blocks, donâ€™t lose the opportunity to install 40+ more free blocks and pre-made design patterns by [Getwid](https://wordpress.org/plugins/getwid/) WordPress blocks. This is a fantastic customization booster and design toolkit for the Gutenberg era in WordPress.
